# NUnit3Migration [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/j9tgafnrx4iwm2uk?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/timootei/nunit3migration)
A Roslyn-based tool that migrates NUnit2 code to NUnit3. Work in progress, contributions are welcome!

# Usage
* Compile the app
* Execute:
```
NUnit3Migration.exe <path to directory>
```

It will recursively search for .cs files and migrate them to NUnit 3 syntax.
